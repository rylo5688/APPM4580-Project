-Last time, we made some plots and from the higher volume (relatively) of 0 and 100% coverage in the landsat outcome, we decided we would predict that.



4/7-
Not sure about the slope as a predictor

Decided that Aspect will not be a good predictor (will require more evidence)

Not sure about collinearity effect of slope and elevation

Not collinearity, but similar interaction between day of year and mods


talked about the independance assumption with the new thingos and justified its assumption

Understand and have idea for a nested logistic regression model. Order based on logic and graphs

Exponential accumulation of errors.
